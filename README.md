Pokemon Quiz app
The first page should have a button that says: "Start quiz".

Upon clicking the button a silhouette of a random pokemon, there must be an input field where
the player can enter the name of the pokemon. After submitting if the name is correct the player
gets a point, if the name is incorrect he gets 0 points.

Reveal the image of the pokemon and tell the user if he was right or wrong before showing
another silhouette.

The quiz must contain 10 pokemon in total, all random (i suggest picking a random one from the
first 151)

There has to be a final screen where you show the result (total score), and where you have a
button to restart the quiz with new pokemon.
